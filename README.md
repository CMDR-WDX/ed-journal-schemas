# ed-journal-schemas

These schemas are compatible with journal events since the release of Odyssey. They are suitable for code generation and documentation.
There is a minimal amount of fields that have validation. No enums have been used for better future compatability. 

These schemas reflect the events that occur in the journal since the Odyssey release(v31). there are fields and events listed that are not in the official documentation provided by Frontier.
There are also fields that are documented in the official documentation provided by Frontier but appear unused.

The community is free to use these schemas for their own projects and improve upon it in the following ways:
- Add additional validation, keeping in mind forward compatibility for code generation.
- Add support for older versions of journal events

See https://jixxed.github.io/ed-journal-schemas/ for more information on the schemas and their usage.
